# NST-Forth
 A Forth kernel for the NST system.
 
 This is a rewrite of an earlier first version. The primary motivation for a total rewrite is to add locals,
with the secondary motivation to use the WIP operating system's ABI for future compatibility.

 Docsify documentation contains the implemented word list.
